Welcome to the Amazon EKS Immersion Workshop!

The intent of this workshop is to use real-world services and demonstrate features of EKS showcasing end-to-end functionality of each feature from application development perspective.

This workshop is based off [EKS Workshop](https://www.eksworkshop.com/) modules but catered towards usecases and ask that most of our customers have demanded as part of EKS Immersions done in the past. This workshop will also use cosistent  services throughout the chapters to keep the continuity for the audience and to give an end-to-end application development and deployment experience
